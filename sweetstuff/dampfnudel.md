# Dampfnudel
## Ingredients
### Dough
* Flour, 500 g
* Sugar, 100 g
* Yeast, 7 g
* Whole milk, 150 ml
* Eggs, 2 ct
* Melted butter, 70 g
* [Optional] Zest of one lemon

### Poaching liquid
* Butter, 25 g
* Whole milk, 150 ml
* Sugar, 25 g

## Directions
Mix the dough, make sure yest is dissolved completely. Knead 5-10 minutes, until it becomes less sticky.
Mix in the zest (if using). Put into oiled bowl, cover, leave in a warm place for about 1-1.5 hours,
until it doubles in size. Split into 12 pieces, flatten to get air out and form into balls.

Put poaching liquid ingredients into a pan with high walls or a wide pot. Mix on a medium heat until sugar
dissolves. Remove from heat and put dough balls into it. Give them some space, they will grow, pan should
be large enough so that dough balls don't touch each other. Leave for about 15 minutes until balls double
in size.

Cover the pan with a lid and put on a low heat. Cook for about 30 minutes until all poaching liquid
evaporates. If it evaporates earlier, add some milk. After 30 minutes, remove lid and cook for 10-15 more
minutes, until bun bottoms brown.
