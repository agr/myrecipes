# Creme brulee
## Ingredients

* Heavy cream, about 500 g
* Milk, about 100 g
* Egg yolks, 6 ct
* Egg whites, 20 g
* Sugar, 90 g
* Vanilla extract, 15 g

## Directions

Gently break egg yolks into a smooth uniform liquid without incorporating air into it, add egg whites, gently mix.
Add the rest of ingredients, gently mix. 1 pint of cream instead of 500 g works, too. After mixing let it rest to
let any air out. Pour into oven proof containers and bake at 100 C/210 F for 1.5 hours. Let it cool and put into
a refrigerator overnight.
