# French crepes
## Ingredients
* Flour, 2 cups
* Sugar, 2 teaspoons
* Salt, 1/2 teaspoons
* Eggs, 6 ct
* Milk, 4 cups
* Butter, 4 tablespoons

## Directions
1. Mix the flour, sugar and salt
2. Gently beat eggs in separate bowl
3. Heat milk until it's warm. It would be needed to make batter warm before adding butter.
4. Add 1.5 - 2 cups of milk into eggs, gently mix.
5. Pour eggs and milk into flour mix, gently stir until no clumps. If you pour all 4 cups of milk at once 
you'll be unable to get rid of all clumps. Stir gently so there are minimal amount of bubbles.
6. Pour the rest of the milk into batter. 
7. Melt butter, stir into batter. Batter should be still warm from milk, otherwise butter will solidify when added.
8. Leave for 30-60 minutes to let bubbles out. Batter can be stored in the fridge.
9. Bake as thin as possible.
